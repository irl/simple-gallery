This is a simple single file photo gallery, this is very rough and improvements n suggestions welcome.

create a folder on your computer called photos-upload/ and place photo-gall.sh in it, dump your images and then run photo-gall.sh to upload straight to your site, make sure to change locations in photo-gall.sh

make sure to create a file called count.txt <- this file keeps track of the file numbering

requirements:
-------------
rsync

imagemagick

ToDo:
-----

consider using sqlite?

figure out some kind of error checking for missing files in the count sequence
